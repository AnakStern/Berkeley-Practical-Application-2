# Berkeley-Practical-Application-2

## This describes the analysis conducted on the available data and conclusions about the 
## factors that have the most influence on the price of a used car.

## Since the available data did not have the original sales price of the vehicle when it was new,
## this analyis does not comment on how well a vehicle maintains its value over time.
## The analysis focuses on what characteristics of used vehicles are most associated with the vehicle price.

## A. Data Adjustments
### 1. There were extensive adjustments to the available data to esure the results would be useful.
### The adjustments assume the client is operating a typical used car dealership which sells cars and
### non-commercial trucks.
### The primary adjustments were:
#### 1. Dropped parts of the dataset with significant missing information or data that was not useful
#### or lacked clarity (e.g., references to the vehicle fuel as "other")
#### 2. Some types of information were not useful for this project.  These include: i) the VIN which has no
#### apparent relationship to the vehicle price; ii) very high-mileage vehicles (odometer reading greater than
#### 150,000 miles); iii) 

## B. Analysis of acceptance of bar coupons
### Approximately 41% of drivers who received a coupon for a bar accepted the coupon
### Overall, drivers who went to a bar more often were significantly more likely to accept a bar coupon.
### About 76% of drivers who went to a bar four or more times per month accepted the bar coupon.
### The influence of age on bar coupon acceptance was unclear and would need further analysis.
### The probability of accepting a bar coupon seems to be higher for drivers who had a passenger that was not a child ("kid").
### The analysis suggests that those who work in farming, fishing or forestry would be more likely to accept a bar coupon (all other things equal).

## C. Analysis of acceptance of coupons for more expensive restaurants
### Approximately 45% of drivers who received a coupon for an expensive accepted the coupon
### Overall, none of the factors analyzed had a significant impact on acceptance of a coupon for an expensive restaurant.
### These factors included time coupon received, driver havng a passenger, driver having children, and driver with no urgent destination.
### Drivers with high income ($75,000 or more) were only slighly more likely to accept a coupon for an expensive restaurant.
### This was not an exhaustive analysis.
### Other factors not analyzed or not in the available dataset may more clearly influence acceptance of a coupon for an expensive restaurant.
